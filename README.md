# curve-it
A utility to calculate the measurements required for a uniform curve when creating a tube.

## Why?

Rolling paper (or similar) into a uniform tube is easy when the top and bottom circumferences are the same - just roll it.

What happens though when you want flange with a larger circumference on top? This utility will calculate the depth of the curve required for create a smooth roll.

## No really, why?

Partly because this is something I had a need for and partly because it was a good excuse to play with functional programming style (in this case in Golang, before moving to a "real" functional language like Elixir)
